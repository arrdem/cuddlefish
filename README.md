In honor of cuddlefish.cs.utexas.edu, my old hacking partner and git's
betentacled nature.

A cute little git wrapper intended to be a light-weight, less
featureful alternative to
[clj-jgit](https://github.com/clj-jgit/clj-jgit).

Mostly code extracted from
[lein-git-version](https://github.com/arrdem/lein-git-version) for use
in other contexts.
